# EEPROMConfig
Store and Retrieve a data structure in EEPROM

Uses the EEPROM library.
The EEPROMConfigClass class from this library should be derived, to provide a custom data structure as well as custom default values setting

This is originally developped for the Iotinator project. It's also my first cpp creation in over 20 years. Ouch. :)
